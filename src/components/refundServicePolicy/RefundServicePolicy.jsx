    The customer can request a refund for services in the following cases: <br />
If Blocklabchain misses the deadline for fulfilling its obligations, the Customer has the right to immediately send a claim; Blocklabchain refunds 100% of the amount paid. <br />
The customer has the right to withdraw without reason at any time, regardless of the service's stage; however, the customer must pay the agency for the costs actually incurred. <br />
The customer can request a refund of the balance of unused funds from the account upon contract termination or in case of disputes about the inability to use Blocklabchain's services. <br />
The Customer may request a refund no later than 7 calendar days after the payment is made: <br />
– If the service has not yet commenced; <br />
– If the Customer decides to decline the provided service, Blocklabchain shall make the refund less the costs incurred. <br />
After 7 calendar days and no later than 6 months from the date of service rendering, the request for a refund shall be considered on a case-by-case basis with the Customer's arguments regarding the poor quality of services rendered.
Refunds are made by Blocklabchain upon a written request from the Customer sent to the email address <a className="sub-page__malito-link" href="mailto:contact@blocklabchain.com">contact@blocklabchain.com</a>. </p>
<p className="sub-page__p p-s">    
The refund request should be made in a free form and should contain the following data: <br />
– The subject of the email should be "Request for Refund". <br />
– Company/project name; <br />
– The name of the service; <br />
– The reason for the refund; <br />
– Amount of payment and currency in which it was made; <br />
– Date of the transaction; <br />
– Contact information (phone number, email). <br />
Grounds for refusing a refund: <br />
– Blocklabchain may deny a refund request if there is evidence of fraud, abuse of reimbursement, resale of agency services, or other manipulative practices. Promotions, upgrades, and changes to existing plans are not eligible for refunds. <br />
Each refund request is reviewed individually, on a first-come, first-served basis, and takes time to process. The refund manager will provide you with information about the status of your request. <br />
Once your refund request is approved, the manager will notify you. The refund process itself may take up to several weeks, depending on your payment method, your bank, and other reasons. <br />
The amount paid for the product will be refunded in the same way as the payment was made. The actual costs incurred by Blocklabchain may be deducted from the refunded amount. <br />
